## Research

PLClub's research often exploits [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) to design and prove properties about programs and programming languages. A few weeks after acceptance, summer students will meet with Joey to discuss their interests. At this point they will have access to a list of project abstracts. Based on this meeting, summer students will be assigned a faculty adviser. If a project meets their interests, they will also be assigned a project. Afterwards, they will meet with their faculty adviser at least one month before the start of the program to finalize a project for the summer. At this point they will be paired with a graduate student whose expertise is relevant to the project. The summer student will meet with the graduate student prior to the start of summer to discuss any prerequisites that may be useful to study before coming to REPL.

When REPL begins, summer students will meet at least weekly with their graduate student, and at least every other week with their faculty adviser. These meetings are meant to troubleshoot their research projects but also provide time for broader guidance. For example, not every meeting must be about the research project. REPL students may want to ask faculty about how they began their research careers, or why they work on what they do. In the last week, each student will present a 15 minute talk to PLClub. Throughout REPL if students feel a project is no longer a good fit and want to switch projects, they may do so by contacting Joey.

Below are project presentations from the 2023 REPL cohort. This isn't exhaustive of the work you can do at REPL but is a good sample of topics. For a more comprehensive list of publications from PLClub see [here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/papers/).
