## Research

PLClub's research often exploits [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) to design and prove properties about programs and programming languages. The abstracts below reflect the sorts of projects students can expect to work on at REPL. The list is neither complete or exhaustive but serves to give students a glance at what kind of work they could be doing. For a more comprehensive list of publications from PLClub see [here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/papers/).

- **A theory of lists.** Many functional programming languages like OCaml, Haskell, and Coq frequently use the list datatype in everyday programs. Formal reasoning about such programs therefore requires a set of properties that standard list library functions should satisfy, but it is open as to what exactly these properties should be. The aim of this project is to build up a theory of lists — a collection of useful theorems and reasoning techniques about the list datatype and its operations. In this project the student will begin by extending the Lists chapter of the Logical Foundations textbook within the Software Foundations series, with theorems inspired by the Coq standard library and functions from OCaml and Haskell. For automating proofs in the theory of lists, the student is advised to consider how ideas from randomized testing, such as quickChick, can help with this process. This project will familiarize the student with developing logical theories, as well as grant hands-on experience with the Coq proof assistant.

- **Learning data generators.** Generating random data is an efficient way to quickly test programs. Generating diverse, well-structured data is especially important if the program relies on complex, user-defined types that adhere to certain rules or assumptions. One approach is property-based testing — in which the programmer specifies some properties that the program should satisfy, and a random generator produces a batch of inputs. The aim of this project is to investigate how machine learning could improve the performance of the QuickCheck property-based testing tool for Haskell. The starting point is a recent work on using reinforcement learning to improve generation of random data, and applying it to the context of property-based testing. The student will gain familiarity with program testing frameworks and experience with designing, training, and applying machine learning models.

- **Proving LLVM optimizations correct.** The LLVM is a compiler toolchain whose intermediate representation (IR) is a popular compile target for various programming languages. Moreover, LLVM offers an array of optimizations over its IR that can increase the performance of the final executable. As LLVM is widely used, it is important that many of its optimizations are indeed correctly implemented. The goal of this project is to verify that simple compiler optimizations, such as dead instruction elimination, dead store store elimination, etc — are indeed correct. The student will learn about the LLVM ecosystem, compiler architectures, as well as formalization of these concepts in Coq.

- **Correct Patricia Tries.** In prior work, several of us at Penn used the Coq proof assistant to verify the properties of finite set and finite map data structures that are used in the Haskell standard library. In the project, we focused on two different representations of finite sets: one based on balanced binary trees and one based on Patricia tries. A previous undergraduate research assistant (Joshua Cohen, now a PhD student at Princeton) also showed that our finite set proofs could be adapted to finite maps in the case of balanced binary trees. However, no one has yet proved the Patricia trie implementation of finite maps correct.

- **Formalization of permutation networks.** Various flavors of permutation networks are commonly used in block-cipher cryptographic algorithms. Formalizing and verifying the properties of a particular variant of permutation networks (e.g. Waksman, Banes, etc) is the first step to formally proving the correctness of a large family of cryptographic algorithms. In this project the student will formalize the semantics of a particular permutation network and use Coq to prove that it satisfies the desired properties. The student will gain exposure to the Coq proof assistant and learn about the relevant cryptographic literature.

A few weeks after acceptance, summer students will meet with Joey to discuss their interests. At this point they will have access to a list of abstracts like those above. Based on this meeting, summer students will be assigned a faculty adviser. If a project meets their interests, they will also be assigned a project. Afterwards, they will meet with their faculty adviser at least one month before the start of the program to finalize a project for the summer. At this point they will be paired with a graduate student whose expertise is relevant to the project. The summer student will meet with the graduate student prior to the start of summer to discuss any prerequisites that may be useful to study before coming to REPL.

When REPL begins, summer students will meet at least weekly with their graduate student, and at least every other week with their faculty adviser. These meetings are meant to troubleshoot their research projects but also provide time for broader guidance. For example, not every meeting must be about the research project. REPL students may want to ask faculty about how they began their research careers, or why they work on what they do. In the last week, each student will present a 15 minute talk to PLClub. Throughout REPL if students feel a project is no longer a good fit and want to switch projects, they may do so by contacting Joey.
