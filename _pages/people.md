## <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~joeyv/">Joey Velez-Ginorio</a> (Codirector) <a href="mailto:joeyv@seas.upenn.edu"><i class="svg-iconh email"></i>


<p class="nn">
Joey is a PhD student advised by Steve Zdancewic and Konrad Körding at the University of Pennsylvania. His research explores the feasability of designing programming languages for the brain. His current work exploits the semantics of linear logic to design typed functional programming languages which compile to neural networks.

<p class="nn">
Stephanie is ENIAC President's Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research is broadly in typed functional programming languages, exploring the integration of dependent types in Haskell, dependent and linear typing, and correct-by-construction data that enforce desired invariants on computation. More details can be found on her <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">personal site.</a>
